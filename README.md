# Bean-Bag-Rumble

Our game, Beanbag Brawl, is a fun party game designed for two people. The goal is to knock your opponents off the map by launching projectiles at them. Our game has two different maps, with different unique features in each:
King of the Turret features a turret in the center that will knock players away from the middle of the map.
Power Ring features two different powerups that increase your playerâ€™s ability: a speed boost and a heavy shot to increase knockback.
